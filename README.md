## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`.
2. Navigate to the project root directory: `cd [project_directory_name]`.
3. Install the required dependencies using Maven: `mvn clean install`.

## Running the Tests

### IntelliJ

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Select `Open` and navigate to the project directory.
3. Wait for IntelliJ to index the project and download the necessary dependencies.
4. Right-click on the test file in the project explorer and select `Run '[TestName]'`.

### Eclipse

1. Open Eclipse.
2. Go to `File` > `Import` > `Existing Maven Projects`.
3. Navigate to the project directory and select the project.
4. Wait for Eclipse to resolve the Maven dependencies.
5. Right-click on the test file in the Package Explorer and select `Run As` > `JUnit Test`.

### Command Line

1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Run the tests using the following command: `mvn test`.

## Things to Think About

### Test Cases to Add

- Comprehensive UI tests such as validation, navigation, responsive design, and cross-browser tests.
- Negative testing.
- Load testing.
- API and database tests if applicable.

### Potential Improvements

- Setting up an automation framework like Cucumber for better collaboration.
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated test execution.
- Parallel test execution to speed up the testing process.
- Enhanced reporting with tools like ExtentReports or Allure.
- Efficient test data management techniques.

### Pain Points

- Browser and driver compatibility issues.
- Maintenance overhead for UI tests.
- Slower execution speed for UI tests.
- False positives due to external factors.
- Complex setups for certain test scenarios.
- Limitations inherent to the tools used.
